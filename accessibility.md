# Design and Accessibility

When designing webpages accessibility considerations are often a legal obligation and everyone must be able to use your content effectively. This introduction will cover the basics of incorporating accessibility into your HTML and CSS coding practices in Visual Studio Code, with a focus on adhering to Ontario's Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA) standards.

## Understanding Accessibility

Accessibility in web design means creating webpages that can be used by as wide an audience as possible, including those with visual, auditory, motor, or cognitive disabilities. This includes designing web content that can be accessed using screen readers, keyboard navigation, and other assistive technologies. It is best to consider accessibility from the start of page design, as retrofitting after can be challenging or even impossible.

## AODA Compliance

The AODA sets standards for accessibility in Ontario, Canada, requiring that digital content be accessible, especially for public sector organizations and large organizations. Following these guidelines not only helps you serve a wider audience but also ensures legal compliance.

As of January 1, 2021, the AODA requires you to make all public websites accessible if you are either:

- a designated public sector organization or
- a business or non-profit organization with 50 or more employees

The Government website https://www.ontario.ca/page/how-make-websites-accessible has details on the rules, who they apply to, how to comply and timelines. 

## Tools and Setup in Visual Studio Code

1. **Visual Studio Code Extensions**: Use extensions like "Accessibility Insights for Web" and "axe Accessibility Linter" to audit your webpages for accessibility issues directly within your development environment.
   
2. **Semantic HTML**: Use semantic elements (e.g., `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`) to structure your content meaningfully. Screen readers and other assistive technologies use these elements to provide context to users.

3. **ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) Roles**: When semantic HTML elements can't achieve the desired structure or functionality, use ARIA roles to define the role of elements on your webpage.

## CSS and Styling for Accessibility

1. **Color and Contrast**: Ensure sufficient contrast between text and background colors to aid users with visual impairments. Tools like "Color Contrast Checker" extensions found in Chrome's DevTools can help you evaluate your color choices.

2. **Responsive Design**: Use responsive design practices (e.g., media queries, flexible grid layouts) to ensure your content is accessible on devices of various sizes and shapes.

3. **Focus Styles**: Customize focus indicators for interactive elements (links, buttons) to make them more noticeable for keyboard-only users.

4. **Text Size and Spacing**: Ensure that text can be resized up to 200% without loss of content or functionality. Use relative units (em, rem) for font sizes and spacing.

## Testing and Validation

1. **Manual Testing**: Regularly test your webpages using keyboard navigation and screen readers to understand firsthand how accessible your site is.

2. **Automated Testing Tools**: Use the integrated testing tools in Visual Studio Code to run automated checks for common accessibility issues.

3. **User Feedback**: Consider gathering feedback from users with disabilities to get insights into how they interact with your webpage and what challenges they face.


By integrating these practices into your HTML and CSS coding in Visual Studio Code, you'll create more inclusive web experiences that comply with Ontario's AODA rules, ensuring your content is accessible to a broader audience.
