# Leaflet Introduction

Leaflet can be an exciting journey into interactive web mapping. Leaflet is a widely-used, open-source JavaScript library that helps you create rich, interactive maps. It's known for its simplicity, performance, and usability, making it a perfect starting point for diving into JavaScript in this course.

## Setting Up Your First Map

1. **HTML File**: Start by creating an HTML file. This will be the backbone of your project. Here's a minimal example:

    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
        <title>My First Leaflet Map</title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.9.4/dist/leaflet.css" integrity="sha256-p4NxAoJBhIIN+hmNHrzRCf9tD/miZyoHS5obTRR9BMY=" crossorigin="" />
    </head>
    <body>
        <div id="map" style="height: 400px;"></div>
        <script src="https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.9.4/dist/leaflet.js" integrity="sha256-20nQCchB9co0qIjJZRGuk2/Z9VM+kNiyxNV1lvTlZBo=" crossorigin=""></script>
        <script>
            // JavaScript code to initialize the map will go here
        </script>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```

    In this HTML skeleton:
    - The Leaflet CSS file from the CDN unpkg.com is included in the `<head>` to style the map correctly. Note the SRI is provided to verify the package from the CDN (see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity for more information)
    - Downloading and using the package is an option, but not a best practice (see https://leafletjs.com/download.html). 
    - A `<div>` element with an id of "map" is where our map will appear. We set a height style to ensure it's visible.
    - The Leaflet JavaScript library is included right before our script tag. This ensures it's loaded before we try to use it in our JavaScript code.

2. **Initializing the Map**: In the JavaScript section within the `<script>` tags, you can initialize your map and set its view to a specific geographical point and zoom level:

    ```javascript
    var map = L.map('map').setView([44.342, -78.741], 13);
    ```

    This code creates a new map in the 'map' div, centers it on the coordinates `[51.505, -0.09]` (latitude, longitude), and sets the zoom level to `13`.

3. **Adding a Tile Layer**: Maps are made up of tiles. You can add a tile layer to your map using a URL template where tiles are fetched from. OpenStreetMap is a common source for these tiles:

    ```javascript
    L.tileLayer('https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png', {
        attribution: 'Â© OpenStreetMap contributors'
    }).addTo(map);
    ```

    This code adds the OpenStreetMap tiles to your map, providing a detailed and styled base map.

### Exploring Further

- **Markers**: You can add markers to your map to denote points of interest. For example, to add a marker at the same coordinates we centered our map on, you could use:

    ```javascript
    L.marker([44.342, -78.741]).addTo(map)
        .bindPopup('A pretty CSS3 popup at Fleming College.<br> Easily customizable.')
        .openPopup();
    ```

- **GeoJSON**: Leaflet has strong support for GeoJSON, a format for encoding a variety of geographic data structures. Adding GeoJSON data can allow you to represent more complex features like lines, shapes, and multi-part geometries.

```javascript
        // URL of the GeoJSON data
        var geojsonURL = 'https://shawnmflemingc.github.io/Geom170/datasets/2024eclipsepath.geojson';

        // Fetch the GeoJSON data
        fetch(geojsonURL)
            .then(function(response) {
                // Check if the request was successful
                if (!response.ok) {
                    throw new Error('Network response was not ok');
                }
                return response.json();  // Parse the response body as JSON
            })
            .then(function(data) {
                // Add the GeoJSON data to the map
                L.geoJSON(data).addTo(map);
            })
            .catch(function(error) {
                // Log any errors to the console
                console.error('Error fetching GeoJSON data:', error);
            });

```

- **Events**: Leaflet makes it easy to respond to user actions through event listeners. For instance, you might want to execute some code when the user clicks on the map.
